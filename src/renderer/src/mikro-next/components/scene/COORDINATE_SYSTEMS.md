# Coordinate systems & the transform graph

How the scene renderer consumes the RFC-5-aligned mikro schema (coordinate
systems as nodes, transformations as edges), what the client derives from it,
and every invariant that keeps a voxel on screen where it belongs.

Companion documents: `OCTREE_RENDERER.md` (the brick-pool image renderer this
feeds), `render/mesh/README.md` (the mesh-collection renderer built on the
same graph).

---

## 1. The model, in three rules

The backend (OME-NGFF RFC-5 aligned) obeys three rules; the renderer's
adapter code is shaped by the same three. When editing anything in
`@/mikro-next/lib/coords/transformGraph.ts` / `core/layerModel.ts` / `core/octree/levelGeometry.ts`,
re-derive from here.

**R1 — Edges are facts; matrices are client work.** The server ships
transformations as edges `(input CS → output CS, params)` and — per SCENE
LAYER — a resolved **path** of edges to the scene's world system
(`Layer.pathToWorld: [{transformation, inverted}]`). The path is itself a
fact, not a shortcut around R1: a layer belongs to exactly one scene, so "this
layer to ITS world" has a single right answer, resolved from the layer's
dataset facts plus that scene's membership edges (never another scene's
registration). What the server still never resolves is a MATRIX: evaluating
each step, inverting the flagged ones, and folding the chain stays
client-side, in exactly one module — `@/mikro-next/lib/coords/transformGraph.ts` — attached to
view-model state once per scene load. Do not compose matrices ad-hoc anywhere
else.

**R2 — Store what was authored or measured; derive everything else.**
Server-derived (we consume, never re-implement): `Lens.renderAxes` (axis
mapping from axis TYPES), `Lens.toParent` (crop translation from slice
starts), `DataArray.toParent` (per-level pixel scale from actual shapes),
`Layer.pathToWorld` / `ImageLayer.levelPaths` (path resolution over the
graph). Client-derived (we own): composed matrices, relative level factors,
GPU uniforms, frustums. If you find yourself persisting any of these, stop.

**R3 — Coordinate systems are nodes, not strings.** Everything spatial is
anchored by CS id: datasets, pyramid levels, lenses, mesh collections, ROIs.
Axis names are only meaningful *within* a CS; all name lookups here go
through a specific CS's axis list.

## 2. What the server ships (the scene fragment)

            │                                #   calibration-independent, what
            │                                #   pyramids/lenses/ROIs resolve against
            ├─ calibrations[]  (not selected) # PHYSICAL spaces, one edge from
            │                                #   intrinsic; recalibration bumps that
            │                                #   edge, nothing drawn in pixels moves
            └─ dataArrays[]                  # pyramid levels
               ├─ coordinateSystem           # this level's array space
               └─ toParent                   # level → intrinsic PIXELS — the scale
                                             #   IS the relative pyramid factor
```

**The unit story.** Intrinsic and array systems are unitless pixel/index
spaces — `Axis.unit` is null there (and `Axis.discrete` no longer exists;
discreteness follows from the system's kind). Units live on CALIBRATED
(`PHYSICAL`) systems and, usually, the world system. Physical voxel size is
therefore NOT in the pyramid's `toParent` edges anymore — it is the
calibration edge (intrinsic → physical), which arrives inside `pathToWorld`.
The scale bar still reads the world CS's first SPACE axis unit, falling back
to "px" (`sceneStore`).

GraphQL documents: `graphql/mikro-next/fragments/{scene,lens,layer,
coordinatesystem,dataroi,meshcollection}.graphql`. The `Transformation`
fragment expands composite edges (Sequence / ByDimension / Bijection) to a
FIXED depth — real edges are shallow (a pyramid level is
`Sequence[Scale, Translation]`; a registration is an `Affine` or
`ByDimension[Identity|Affine]`). If the server ever nests deeper, the extra
depth silently drops out of the query — extend the fragment, not the parser.

Gone from the wire (and from `ImageLayerFragment`): `Layer.affineMatrix`,
`ImageLayer.xDim/yDim/zDim/tDim/intensityDim`, `DataArray.scaleFactors`,
`Scene.spatialUnit/temporalUnit`, `DataRoi.dataset/xDim/yDim/zDim`,
`ADataset.coordinateSystem` (→ `intrinsicSystem` + `calibrations`),
`Axis.discrete`, `AxisType.ARRAY`.

**Deliberate fragment omissions (perf):**
- `lens.coordinateSystem` / `dataset.intrinsicSystem` are selected **id+name
  only** — their axis order equals the layer's dims by contract ("a selection
  never drops or reorders an axis"), so selecting axes only duplicated dims
  in every payload.
- `scene.coordinateSystems` is NOT selected (removed once §7 item 1 shipped):
  every edge carries `inputAxes`/`outputAxes`, which was the global list's
  only client-side job. The axis-resolution order in `transformGraph.ts` is
  edge-carried lists → CS index (world only now) → layer dims.
- `ZarrStore.accessGrant` / `ParquetStore.accessGrant` are NOT selected in the
  scene fragment — each grant is a server-side STS call; selecting them per
  store would turn one scene query into a dozen credential mints. Grants are
  requested lazily (zarr: existing store flow; parquet: mutation on mesh-layer
  mount).
- `CoordinateAnchor.valueHistogram` IS still selected (clim defaults + the
  brick pool's global min/max normalization need it, `core/dataRange.ts`).
  It is always PRECOMPUTED server-side — there is no on-demand evaluation
  path; the field is either present or null. So selecting it costs only wire
  size (a few hundred floats per anchor), and a null histogram simply means
  clims resolve against the dtype range (the fallback `dataRange.ts` already
  implements).

---

## 3. What the client derives, and where

One rule of altitude: **everything below `core/transformGraph.ts` and
`core/layerModel.ts` still sees the pre-migration flat facts.** The octree
planner, culling, slab math, probes and panels were not rewritten — they
consume derived fields with the exact semantics the server fields used to
have. The migration is an adapter, not a rewrite.

| Derived fact | From | Where | Consumed by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `LayerState.affineMatrix` (voxel→world 4×4, x/y/z rows) | local prefix (`lens.toParent`, level-0 `toParent`) ∘ `pathToWorld` steps | `composeLayerAffine` (`core/transformGraph.ts`), once per scene load in `normalizeLayer` | `worldTransform.buildAffineMatrix`, `voxelFrame.buildVolumeVoxelToWorld`, `nodePlanning` 2D slab inverse, `visibility`, `RoiDrawer` |
| `LayerState.xAxis/yAxis/zAxis/tAxis/intensityAxis` | `lens.renderAxes` | `normalizeLayer` (`core/layerModel.ts`) | `resolveAxisIndices` and ~15 call sites (slice signature, probes, panels) |
| Relative level factors (old `scaleFactors` semantics) | `toParent` pixel scales, `rel = abs_L / abs_0` (a no-op now that level 0 = 1) | `relativeLevelScaleFactors` / `buildLevelSources` (`core/octree/levelGeometry.ts`) | level geometry, plan tracker, residency, pool viability, probe geometry |
| `spatialUnit` | first SPACE axis of the world CS | `sceneStore` | `ScaleBar` |
| Mesh transforms | `MeshLayer.pathToWorld` via `composePlacementPath` | `core/transformGraph.ts` | `render/mesh/MeshCollectionLayer` |

Raw-fragment code paths that run BEFORE normalization (`lodPlanning`,
`renderCost`, `renderGraph.defaultLayerGraph`, `colormap-utils`) read
`layer.lens.renderAxes` directly.

### 3.1 `composeLayerAffine` — local prefix + server path

```
lens voxel ──toParent──▶ level-0 array ──toParent──▶ intrinsic pixels
 (crop translation)      (pyramid factor, ≈identity)
                                │
                 pathToWorld steps, evaluated in order
                                ▼
        … ──calibration edge──▶ physical ──registration──▶ world
             (pixel size — the ONLY place it lives)
```

- `composePlacementPath(steps, scene, spatial)` evaluates each step's
  transformation with `evalTransform` and **matrix-inverts** (`invert4`,
  pure affine adjugate) the steps flagged `inverted` — the server marks edges
  it traversed output→input. Singular inverses degrade like unknown kinds.
- The path starts at the layer's SOURCE system, but the renderer's voxel
  frame is the LENS grid — so `composeLayerAffine` prepends whatever local
  prefix the path does not cover, keyed off the path's actual start CS:
  starts at the lens CS → no prefix; at the level-0 array CS → prepend
  `lens.toParent`; anywhere else (intrinsic, typically) → prepend both
  `toParent`s. This makes the client indifferent to which source the server
  chooses, and immune to double-applying the crop.
- `pathToWorld: null` (unregistered layer) → local prefix only; the layer
  stays in its intrinsic pixel frame (warn once) — exactly the old
  `affineMatrix: null` behavior. `[]` (source IS world) → local prefix only,
  no warning.
- Arrays (`scale`, `translation`, affine rows/cols) are in the **axis order
  of the edge's input CS**. The spatial subset is extracted **by axis name**
  via `renderAxes` (never by position). Axis orders come from
  `scene.coordinateSystems` (fetched with full axes precisely for this);
  unknown systems fall back to the layer's dim order.
- Affine edges are `M × (N+1)`, rows in OUTPUT axis order, last column the
  translation — `evalTransform` maps the spatial block name-by-name between
  input and output systems (tested against the FLIM registration numbers).
- **Degradation is always to identity, never to a wrong matrix.** Edge kinds
  the evaluator cannot represent as a spatial affine (MapAxis permutations,
  Bijections, Displacement fields) warn once and drop out. If you add support
  for a kind, add it to `evalTransform`'s switch and to
  `transformGraph.test.ts` — nowhere else.
- `ImageLayer.levelPaths` (per pyramid level → world) is NOT selected: the
  octree renderer keeps one matrix per layer plus relative level factors, so
  querying it would pay per-level server path resolutions for nothing. When
  per-level placement lands (e.g. with the translation work below), reselect
  it and feed `levelPaths[level].path` through `composePlacementPath` —
  every level stars into the same intrinsic system, so the registration tail
  is shared.

### 3.2 Per-level scales: pixel factors in, relative factors out

RFC-5 levels are a STAR, not a chain: every level's `toParent` outputs the
same intrinsic system. With intrinsic = the level-0 PIXEL grid, a level edge's
scale IS the true relative factor (derived from actual shapes — a 36-slice z
pyramid gives 1,2,4,9,18,36, not the nominal-but-false 1,2,4,8,16,32), and
physical voxel size lives exclusively on the calibration edge.
`relativeLevelScaleFactors` still divides by level 0 — a no-op now (level 0 =
1), kept so physical-scaled level edges from older data remain correct.
Because `scale·shape == const` per axis, declared factors agree with
`resolveAxisScale`'s shape-ratio fallback by construction — they just
short-circuit it, and pyramids whose edges we can't read (missing `toParent`,
affine level edges) fall back cleanly.

`buildLevelSources` is THE one `LevelSource[]` builder (plan tracker,
residency manager and pool-viability probe all call it). Do not hand-roll a
fourth copy.

**Deferred on purpose — per-level TRANSLATION.** `Sequence[Scale,
Translation]` level edges carry the half-voxel offset introduced by
downsampling (`(f−1)/2`, in intrinsic pixels). The renderer does not consume it
yet: sampling assumes corner-aligned levels, which is the pre-migration
status quo (coarse LODs draw up to half a coarse voxel off — reads as "soft
when zoomed out"). Consuming it is a LOCKSTEP change across
`nodeBaseBox`/`slabLevelZ` (planner), `brickNodeMaterials` (TSL sampling
map), and `brickSampling` (CPU probe march) — see OCTREE_RENDERER.md P15/P14
for why these three must move together. Recommended shape: apply translation
exactly in the *sampling* path, keep brick *addressing* corner-aligned.

**Known planner nit for true-factor pyramids:** adjacent levels need not
divide evenly (z 4→9 is 2.25×), so `childrenOf` boxes don't nest exactly and
the DFS can visit a straddling child from two parents (no visited-set).
Bounded double-accounting; add dedup in `planLayerNodes` when translation
work lands.

### 3.3 Lenses and the crop offset

A cropped lens' voxel coordinates are OFFSET from its dataset's;
`lens.toParent` records that offset. Composition folds it into the layer
matrix, so anything downstream of `affineMatrix` is crop-correct.
Residual pre-existing hole (unchanged by the migration): the octree fetch
path plans in DATASET voxel space and applies `lens.slices` only to
non-spatial dims (`brickResidency.ts` fixed-index collapse) — a spatially
cropped lens fetches the full extent. Fixing that means clamping the
planner's visible box to the lens window; the transform side is already
correct.

`buildSliceSignature` keeps its exact semantics (axis mapping + non-spatial
slices; `currentZ` deliberately excluded — see OCTREE_RENDERER.md P15).

### 3.4 ROIs

`DataRoi` is CS-anchored (`coordinateSystem` + `vectors` + `selectors`), not
dataset/dim-string-anchored. Creation (`interactions/RoiDrawer.tsx`): the
drawn world points are inverse-transformed through the clicked layer's
composed matrix **once, at creation** — the inverse of
`lens→world` lands them in exactly the lens' CS, which is what the mutation
anchors to. No mirrored world geometry, no reconciliation at read time.
`createdWithTransforms` is provenance only — never used for resolution.

### 3.5 Axis mapping is structural now

`renderAxes` is derived server-side from axis TYPES (SPACE/TIME/CHANNEL), so
the P16 class of bug (`intensityAxis === zAxis`, 16 phantom channels, 512 MB
atlas) is structurally impossible — a dim cannot be two types. The
`resolveAxisIndices` collision guard stays as defense in depth. The spatial
dims are no longer user-editable, and the intensity mapping is persisted
through the render graph (`ChannelSourceNode.intensityAxis`), not a flat
layer field.

---

## 4. Frames: the centering convention and co-registration

The one place the old world and the new world genuinely differ:

- **Image layers** render in `affine ∘ centering(lens.shape, y-flip)`
  (`voxelFrame.buildVolumeVoxelToWorld`) — each layer centers itself on the
  origin. Historically "world" was whatever the layer affine said; now the
  composed matrix targets the scene's world CS (physical µm), and the
  centering still rides on top per layer.
- **Graph-anchored things** (meshes, ROIs from other datasets) composed
  purely through the graph land UNCENTERED and un-flipped relative to that.

Current resolution (v1, encoded in `render/mesh/MeshCollectionLayer.tsx`
`resolveCollectionMatrix`): a mesh collection first looks for an image layer
in the scene whose lens/intrinsic-system/pyramid contains its CS — the labels
layer it was extracted from — and reuses THAT layer's full frame, so meshes
and labels overlap by construction. Only when no such layer exists does it
fall back to composing the mesh layer's own `pathToWorld` (warn once).

The real fix is a **scene-root frame normalization**: compose all transforms
pure (voxel → world µm), apply ONE y-flip + fit matrix on the scene root, and
delete per-layer centering. That touches `sceneFit`, `probeMath`/`probeWorld`,
`RoiDrawer`, `ZSliderPanel` and the 2D slab math in lockstep — do it as its
own change, not as a rider.

---

## 5. Debugging a misplaced layer

1. `console.warn` first — every degradation path warns once with the edge
   type and CS ids (`[transformGraph] …`, `[mesh] …`). A silent wrong
   position means the numbers composed; a warned identity means an edge or
   step didn't. "no path to the scene's world system (unregistered)" means
   the SERVER returned `pathToWorld: null` — the layer isn't registered into
   this scene; that's a data/registration question, not a client bug.
2. Layer renders in raw pixels (1 px = 1 world unit): the path composed but
   contained no calibration edge — inspect `pathToWorld` in Apollo devtools;
   the pixel→physical scale must appear as one of its steps.
3. Check the chain piecewise: `composeLayerAffine` and
   `composePlacementPath` are pure — feed them the fragment from Apollo
   devtools, compare against hand-multiplied step matrices (invert the
   `inverted: true` ones). `transformGraph.test.ts` has worked examples to
   copy from.
4. Axis-order suspicion: arrays are input-CS-ordered. If a CS is missing from
   `scene.coordinateSystems`, its edges evaluate against the layer's dim
   order — check the fragment actually selected `coordinateSystems`.
5. Crop applied twice (or not at all): the local-prefix detection keys off
   the path's start CS (`pathStartId`). Compare the first step's input (or
   output, if inverted) CS id against `lens.coordinateSystem.id` and the
   level-0 array CS id.
6. Level scale suspicion: `relativeLevelScaleFactors` must equal the shape
   ratios (`scale·shape == const` invariant). If they don't, the server wrote
   inconsistent `toParent` edges — that's a data bug, surface it, don't
   patch it client-side.
7. Half-a-coarse-voxel offsets at coarse LOD only: that's the deferred
   translation (§3.2), not a regression.

---

## 6. Server-side performance expectations

The scene query resolves a CS (+axes) per lens, per dataset, a `toParent`
per data array, plus ONE `pathToWorld` graph resolution per layer (the
per-level `levelPaths` field is deliberately unqueried — see §2). That is
fine **if** the resolvers prefetch (`select_related`/dataloaders); if
`levelPaths` is ever reselected, its path search must be memoized per
(dataset, scene) — every level shares the registration tail. If scene loads
regress, profile the backend before touching the client — the fragment shape
is already minimal (see §2's deliberate omissions).

---

## 7. Strict-backend contract (proposed enforcement)

Observed divergences from live payloads (debug scene 82, 2026-07-14) and the
rule that prevents each. The client degrades safely around all of them, but
degradation hides data bugs — enforce these server-side:

1. **Edges self-describe their axis order.** ✅ SHIPPED (2026-07-14):
   `Transformation.inputAxes/outputAxes` are non-null interface fields —
   parameter order for scale/translation/affine columns, SUBSET-only for
   ByDimension children (unnamed axes pass through untouched; the evaluator
   leaves identity rows for them). The client dropped
   `scene.coordinateSystems` from the fragment; axis resolution is
   edge-carried → world-CS index → layer dims.
2. **An ACTIVE layer always has a path to world.** Scene 82's layer ships
   `pathToWorld: null` with empty `registrations` — the layer was
   never registered. Placing a layer into a scene MUST create the
   registration edge (identity by default, editable later); if a layer can
   legitimately be unregistered, give it a distinct `status` so the client
   can badge it instead of silently drawing in the pixel frame.
3. **`ChannelSourceNode.intensityAxis` must name a CHANNEL-typed axis.**
   Live data shipped `intensityAxis: "t"` on a time-lapse — 16 timepoints
   would render as 16 stacked channel slabs (the P16 failure shape) and the
   t-slider would vanish (t counts as "rendered"). The client now guards
   (`resolveIntensityDim`, `core/dims.ts`: graph mapping wins only when it
   doesn't name a spatial/time render axis), but the write path should
   reject it.
4. **Histogram bins are linear — ship the rule, not the samples.** STILL
   OPEN: `ValueHistogram.bins` remains 256 floats of uniformly spaced bin
   EDGES (fully derivable from min/max/count); in scene 82's payload it
   dwarfs everything else. Replace with `binMin/binMax/binCount` (+ keep the
   count array); the levels-editor histogram consumes `bins` today and
   adapts trivially.
5. **`worldCoordinateSystem` non-null** on Scene (the client treats a missing
   world as "nothing registers anywhere").

Shipped alongside item 1 (unconsumed for now): `Scene.epoch` — the
wall-clock origin of the world time axis (`wall_clock = epoch + t·unit`).
The natural consumer is the t-slider's label (absolute timestamps instead of
frame indices) once a TIME calibration edge maps frame → physical time; see
the dim-slider follow-ups in OCTREE_RENDERER.md §2.2.

## 8. Test map

| Concern | Tests |
| --- | --- |
| Edge evaluation, `invert4`, placement-path composition (incl. inverted steps), layer prefix detection, unregistered degradation | `core/transformGraph.test.ts` |
| Pixel-factor and legacy physical-scale level edges, identity/translation edges, fallback | `core/transformGraph.test.ts` ("level scale factors") |
| Planner/geometry under true factors | `core/octree/nodePlanning.test.ts`, `levelGeometry` coverage via existing octree tests |
| Mesh cell math, planning, decoding, cache | `render/mesh/meshCore.test.ts` |

The reference scene document (confocal + FLIM + mesh collection) doubles as
the fixture source — its hand-computed numbers (the 0.325/0.5 µm calibration
scale, the 0.998/±0.021 FLIM affine, true z factors 1,2,4,9,18,36) appear
verbatim in the tests. When the schema evolves, update the tests from a NEW
hand computation, not from the code's output.
